      <p>I was born and raised in Salt Lake City. I went to college at Westminster and I studied fine art.  After graduation, I decided to move
        to Seattle, where I would love to end up again one day.
      <p>In Seattle, I worked as an AmeriCorps member for social service agencies.  My favorite thing was teaching art classes to teenagers
        in residential treatment.  When I moved back to Utah, I continued to work in the nonprofit world.  Eventually I decided to explore graphic
        design as a career and worked for a while designing wedding invitations.  After that, I landed at my current job, which involves design
        and general marketing.  After taking an introductory HTML/CSS couse through the U, I decided to explore coding.</p>
      <p>When I'm not working, I'm working on side art projects, hiking, gardening, reading, going to the movies, or spending time with
        friends and family.</p>
